\textbf{Textbook:} \textit{Habitat Young Leaders Build: Leadership Academy Toolkit}, 1st Edition, by Center for Creative Leadership, 2018. 

\textbf{Course Description:} Habitat for Humanity (Habitat) brings people together to build homes, communities, and hope. The Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) seeks to advance the understanding, practice and development of leadership for the benefit of society worldwide. Together, Habitat and CCL have created a partnership for impact to engage and empower young people. We believe every young person can be a citizen leader. Alternatively, most young people do not receive the support or experiences that will develop their skills for the leadership demands today. We believe earlier leadership development and the exposure to sustainable development projects is important for youth to be prepared to be citizen leaders in a complex and interdependent world.
The HYLB Leadership Academy is part of an integrated, multidimensional approach to creating sustainable communities, youth development, and community well-being. The program is designed to develop youth as citizen leaders. Academy elements include: 2 day youth leadership program delivered with youth and a sustainable development project led by youth.  

\textbf{Course Objectives:} Participants see themselves as leaders. When youth see themselves as leaders they are more likely to engage in leadership development and more willing to participant in community change initiatives. Participants grow in their abilities to be a leader, particularly in regard to Leading Self, Leading with Others, and Changing Your World indicators. Participants see themselves as change agents and have concrete ideas about how to use their leadership skills to help them make a positive difference in their community. The Leadership Academy aims to be the pathway to better opportunities: Positons youth for on-going positive results; Inspired youth do more, dream big, and create impact in their communities; Better educational outcomes; Better quality of life, healthier; socially active youth. Youth-led community a ctivities, more sustainable communities, academy becomes a model to inform the leadership and development field more broadly.
