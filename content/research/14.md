##### Abstract

The mapping study on youth and civil society in urban Cambodia has been conducted to understand the current space of Cambodian youths. The study aims to understand the aspirations, opportunities, challenges, concerns, and the needs of youth actors, and potential actors. The purpose is therefore to provide the EUD with a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse landscape of civil society actors in Cambodia committed to empowering urban youth, to foster their participation and agency, their engagement in issues of public interest and in promoting transformative change in the country.
